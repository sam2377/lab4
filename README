A. 
	identifier for double average(double* n1,double &n2): _Z7averagePdRd

	identifier for int average(int n1,float n2): _Z7averageif

B.
	output:
			1 8
			4 8
			4 8
			8 8
	WHY:
		Under the 64-bit OS system, each pointer contains an address. Therefore, each pointer variable takes up 8 bytes memory.
		each char variable takes up 1 byte memory.
		each int variable takes up 4 bytes memory.
		each float variable takes up 4 bytes memory.
		each double variable takes up 8 bytes memory.
